🐍 Python Fundamentals & Practice Projects
This repository contains a series of exercises and mini-projects developed while learning and reinforcing Python basics, data handling, and object-oriented programming.

📘 Topics Covered
🔤 Data Types & Variables
Practiced working with strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Explored type conversion and dynamic assignment.
🔄 Control Flow
Built logic using:
- if, elif, and else conditions
- for loops and while loops for iteration and control
🔧 Functions
Created custom functions with parameters, return values, and basic error handling.
📦 Custom Classes & Object-Oriented Design
- Developed a User class with a dynamic age property.
- Built a Student database using custom objects to manage names, grades, and academic records.
- Explored encapsulation, constructors, and instance methods.
🧱 Data Structures (No Built-In Collections)
- Implemented a basic Stack from scratch using manual node chaining (push, pop, and print functionality).
- Used pointer-style logic to traverse and manipulate custom objects.
📁 File Management
- Read from and wrote to text files.
- Handled file opening modes and resource cleanup with with statements.
📊 CSV and JSON Handling
- Parsed CSV files manually and using Python’s built-in csv module.
- Loaded and dumped JSON data using the json module.
- Simulated basic data persistence with structured formats.
🧰 Module Usage
- Used built-in modules like datetime, csv, json, and os to handle dates, file formats, and system tasks.

💡 
These exercises covered the essential building blocks of Python — from syntax and structure to real-world data scenarios. Each project reinforced logic fluency, problem-solving, and hands-on debugging, with increasing confidence in writing clean, reusable code.
