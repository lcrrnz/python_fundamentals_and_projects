# 🐍 Python Fundamentals & Practice Projects

This repository documents a 15-week journey through Python programming, data structures, and algorithmic thinking. Each week builds on the last, progressing from syntax basics to custom implementations and performance analysis. Exercises and mini-projects were designed to reinforce logic fluency, hands-on debugging, and expressive code narration.

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 🔤 Data Types & Variables
- Strings, integers, floats, booleans
- Type conversion and dynamic assignment

### 🔄 Control Flow
- `if`, `elif`, `else` conditions
- `for` and `while` loops
- Nested logic and edge case handling

### 🔧 Functions
- Custom functions with parameters and return values
- Basic error handling and input validation
- Infinite parameters: `*args`, `**kwargs`
- Decorators for wrapping and extending behavior

### 📦 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes, objects, constructors, and instance methods
- Encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism
- Inheritance and multiple inheritance
- Abstract classes and method overriding

### 🧱 Custom Data Structures (No Built-In Collections)
- Manual implementation of:
  - Stack
  - Singly linked list
  - Queue and deque
  - Binary tree (basic traversal and node logic)
- Pointer-style logic and node chaining
- Edge case analysis and iterative debugging

### 📁 File Management
- Reading and writing `.txt` files
- File modes and cleanup using `with` statements

### 📊 CSV and JSON Handling
- Manual parsing and use of `csv` and `json` modules
- Simulated data persistence with structured formats

### 🧰 Module Usage
- Built-in modules: `datetime`, `csv`, `json`, `os`
- Handling dates, file formats, and system tasks

### 🧠 Algorithm Analysis
- Sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort
- Time complexity reasoning with Big O notation
- Performance trade-offs and intuitive comparisons

### 🛠️ Git & GitHub Workflow
- Installed Git and configured GitHub
- Created branches, committed changes, and opened pull requests
- Structured repositories with clear README files and naming conventions
