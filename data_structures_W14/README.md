# Week 14: Custom Data Structures 🧮🐍

## 🧭 Overview
This week focused on building core data structures manually to understand how they work under the hood. Topics included linked lists, queues, deques, and binary trees.

I created my **first custom queue** using nodes, pointers, and control logic — applying everything I’ve learned so far about functions, classes, and object-oriented design.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 🔗 Linked List
A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next. Useful for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions.

### 📥 Queue
First-in, first-out (FIFO) structure. Built manually using a linked list approach.

### 🔄 Deque
Double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal from both ends.

### 🌳 Binary Tree
Hierarchical structure where each node has up to two children. Useful for search, sorting, and hierarchical data representation.
