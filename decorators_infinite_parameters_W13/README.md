# Week 13: Infinite Parameters and Decorators 🧪🐍

## 🧭 Overview
This week explored how to write flexible functions using variable-length arguments, and how to enhance or modify function behavior using decorators.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### ✳️ *args
Allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments as a tuple.

### ✳️ **kwargs
Allows a function to accept any number of keyword arguments as a dictionary.

### 🧵 Decorators
Functions that wrap other functions to add or modify behavior without changing the original code. Often used for logging, validation, timing, and access control.

### 🧩 Nested Functions
Functions defined inside other functions, often used in decorators or closures.
