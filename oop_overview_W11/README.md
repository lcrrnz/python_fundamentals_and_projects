# Week 11: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🧱🐍

## 🧭 Overview
This week introduced the principles of object-oriented programming in Python. I practiced designing classes, creating objects, and organizing behavior using methods and attributes.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Defining classes with `class`
- Creating objects (instances)
- Using `__init__` to initialize attributes
- Writing methods to define behavior
- Understanding `self` and encapsulation
