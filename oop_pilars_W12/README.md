# Week 12: Core Principles of Object-Oriented Programming 🧱🐍

## 🧭 Overview
This week focused on the most widely used pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. Topics included inheritance, multiple inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, abstract classes, and polymorphism.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 🧬 Inheritance
Allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class.

### 🧬 Multiple Inheritance
Enables a class to inherit from more than one base class.

### 🧱 Encapsulation
Restricts direct access to internal data using private attributes and accessor methods.

### 🎭 Abstraction
Hides implementation details and exposes only essential features.

### 🧩 Abstract Classes
Define method requirements for subclasses using the `abc` module.

### 🔀 Polymorphism
Allows different classes to implement the same method in different ways.
