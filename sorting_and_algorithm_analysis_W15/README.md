# Week 15: Sorting Algorithms & Big O Notation 📊🐍

## 🧭 Overview
This week focused on understanding how algorithms perform and scale. I studied common sorting techniques and learned how to analyze their efficiency using Big O notation.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 🔃 Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** — Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements. Simple but inefficient.
- **Selection Sort** — Selects the smallest element and places it in order.
- **Insertion Sort** — Builds the sorted list one item at a time.
- (Other algorithms may be introduced later, like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.)

### 📈 Big O Notation
Describes the time and space complexity of algorithms:
- **O(1)** — Constant time
- **O(n)** — Linear time
- **O(n²)** — Quadratic time
- **O(log n)** — Logarithmic time
- **O(n log n)** — Efficient sorting algorithms

Used to compare algorithm performance and predict behavior as input size grows.
