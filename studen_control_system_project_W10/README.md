# Week 10: Modules & Student Control System 🧑‍🎓📦

## 🧭 Overview
This week introduced Python modules and project structure. I built my first real application: a Student Control System, using modular code and basic data handling.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Creating and importing Python modules
- Organizing code into separate files for readability and reuse
- Using functions across modules
- Building a simple system to manage student data (e.g., add, search, update)
